# Chat App

I have recently completed a mobile application project. The Chat App, developed using Flutter, is a versatile mobile application that offers a wide range of features to enhance user communication and engagement.

## Features
- **One-to-one Chat:** Implemented a seamless one-to-one chat feature that allows users to exchange messages with their friends, promoting effective communication.
- **Phone Calls:** Integrated the ability to make phone calls to friends directly within the app, enhancing user connectivity.
- **Story Sharing:** Developed a feature for users to upload and view stories in the form of photos and text, promoting user-generated content.
- **Friends' Stories:** Enabled users to view stories shared by their friends, fostering a sense of community and shared experiences.
- **Phone Authentication:** Implemented a secure and user-friendly phone authentication system with OTP verification, ensuring the privacy and identity of users.
- **Profile Screen:** Created a user-friendly profile screen that displays the user's name and photo, allowing users to personalize their profiles.

## Technologies Used
- **MVVM Architecture:** Utilized the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern to create a scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **Cubit for State Management:** Employed Cubit as a state management solution to efficiently manage the application's state and data flow.
- **Firebase Cloud:** Leveraged Firebase services for real-time data synchronization, database management, and user authentication.
- **Firebase Storage:** Utilized Firebase Storage for efficient and scalable storage of user-generated content, including stories and media.
- **Firebase Authentication:** Integrated Firebase Authentication for secure user registration and login processes.
